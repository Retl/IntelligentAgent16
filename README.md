IntelligentAgent16
==================
The most up to date version can always be played here: retl.github.io/IntelligentAgent16/game.html
WebGL Action Game for touch devices. (WebGL is currently not implemented.)
The player controls IA16. Tapping within the Area of Influence will create a microburst and move the player in the direction of their touch. Tapping outside of the area of influence fires a powerful Snipe Attack. The IA16's energy is drained over time. Energy can be regained by destroying targets. Run out of energy, and the player's connection to IA16 is severed, ending gameplay. (Free free to sit around afterwards and watch the helpless IA16 get knocked all around the playing area if you wish.)
